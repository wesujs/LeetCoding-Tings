# Welcome to My LeetCode Repository

[![My LeetCode Profile](https://leetcode.com/wesujs/)](https://leetcode.com/wesujs/)

## Introduction

Hello there! This is my LeetCode repository, where I keep track of my solutions to various LeetCode problems. LeetCode is an excellent platform for sharpening coding skills, practicing algorithms, and preparing for technical interviews.

## Contents

In this repository, you will find:

- **Solutions**: Code implementations of various LeetCode problems.
- **Approach**: Detailed explanations of my thought process and strategies used to solve the problems.
- **Data Structures**: Implementations of common data structures that I frequently use in my solutions.
- **Algorithms**: Implementations of essential algorithms and techniques.

## Motivation

I created this repository to share my progress, help others in their coding journey, and receive feedback on my solutions. By making my code public, I hope it can serve as a learning resource for other developers and inspire discussions on alternative approaches to problem-solving.

## Contribution

I welcome contributions and feedback! If you have a better solution to any problem, found a bug, or want to optimize an existing solution, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Together, we can enhance this repository and create an even more valuable resource for the LeetCode community.
